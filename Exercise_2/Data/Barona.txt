Hi I am Md Mahade Hasan. I am a second year masters student at tampere university. During the next summer, I am looking for a job in the cleaning industry. I have some prior experience in cleaning such as office cleaning, lobby cleaning, stair cleaning and hotel room cleaning. Besides, I have basic knowledge of dishwashing. Apart from that, I have my own hygine passport which proves that I know all the hygine rule to work in the restaurants as well. With my ability and experiences I am confident that I am suitable for any cleaning job. I hope to hear from you soon.
